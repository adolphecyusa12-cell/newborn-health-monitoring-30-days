# 🩺 30-Day Newborn Health Monitoring System

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on designing and analyzing a **data-driven health monitoring system for newborns during their first 30 days of life**.  
The system supports structured data collection, analysis, and visualization to assist healthcare monitoring and decision-making.

The project demonstrates how **SQL-based databases, analytics, and dashboards** can be used to track early-life health indicators in a safe and ethical manner.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Design a relational database for newborn health monitoring
- Track key indicators such as vitals, illnesses, and immunization status
- Perform analytical queries to identify health trends
- Support evidence-based decision-making using data

---

## 🗂️ Data Description
The dataset represents anonymized information collected during the **first 30 days of life**, including:
- Basic newborn identifiers (non-PII)
- Daily vital signs
- Illness occurrences
- Immunization events

⚠️ No personally identifiable information (PII) is included.

---

## 🧱 Database Design
he database schema follows a normalized relational design centered on the `babies` table, 
with daily monitoring tables linked via foreign keys. This structure supports longitudinal 
analysis of newborn health indicators over the first 30 days of life.

The database follows **relational design principles** with:
- Primary and foreign keys
- One-to-many relationships
- Normalized tables to reduce redundancy

Example tables include:
- `newborn babies informtaion`
- `daily vitals information`
- `illness records`
- `immunizations record`

## 📊 Clinical Analytics Dashboard

The dashboard summarizes key newborn health indicators over the first 30 days of life,
including temperature, weight growth, vital signs, immunization timeline, and oxygen
saturation. Warning flags highlight potential clinical risks requiring attention.
