# 🩺 30-Day Newborn Health Monitoring System

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on designing and analyzing a **data-driven health monitoring system for newborns during their first 30 days of life**.  
The system supports structured data collection, analysis, and visualization to assist healthcare monitoring and decision-making.

The project demonstrates how **SQL-based databases, analytics, and dashboards** can be used to track early-life health indicators in a safe and ethical manner.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Design a relational database for newborn health monitoring
- Track key indicators such as vitals, illnesses, and immunization status
- Perform analytical queries to identify health trends
- Support evidence-based decision-making using data

---

## 🗂️ Data Description
The dataset represents anonymized information collected during the **first 30 days of life**, including:
- Basic newborn identifiers (non-PII)
- Daily vital signs
- Illness occurrences
- Immunization events

⚠️ No personally identifiable information (PII) is included.

---

## 🧱 Database Design
The database follows **relational design principles** with:
- Primary and foreign keys
- One-to-many relationships
- Normalized tables to reduce redundancy

Example tables include:
- `newborns`
- `daily_vitals`
- `illness_records`
- `immunizations`

## 🧮 Methods & Tools
**Technologies used:**
- **SQL** — database design and analytical queries  
- **R** — data analysis and visualization  
- **Power BI** — dashboard creation  
- **GitHub** — version control and documentation  

---

## 📊 Key Analyses
- Trends in newborn vital signs over time
- Frequency and timing of illness events
- Immunization coverage during the neonatal period
- Summary indicators for monitoring outcomes
